### The flow of play

1. The round starts with all the dice being rolled
2. Whoever is starting the round becomes the caller
3. The caller views the dice OR does not
  - If the caller views the dice, then they roll 0-5 of the dice and views the dice
4. The caller makes a call
5. The next player in order (the receiver) accepts OR rejects the call
  - If the receiver rejects the call, then the dice are revealed and compared to the call
    - If the call is greater than or equal to the dice, then the caller wins and the round ends: the receiver loses one life and starts the next round
    - If the call is less than the dice, then the receiver wins and the round ends: the caller loses one life and starts the next round
  - If the receiver accepts the call, then they become the caller
6. Go back to (3)

### The dice

- There are five dice and each die has six values.
- Each die can only be one value at a time.
- Rolling a die changes its value to any of the six possible options, with equal probability, including the value it had just before it was rolled.
- The six values are:
  - Highest ranking
    - 'A' or 'Ace'
    - 'K' or 'King'
    - 'Q' or 'Queen'
    - 'J' or 'Jack'
    - '10' or 'Ten'
    - '9' or 'Nine'
  - Lowest ranking
